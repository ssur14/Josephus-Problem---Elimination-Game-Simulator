# Program-1---CS010C


This C++ program simulates a circular elimination game based on the Josephus problem. It begins by reading the number of players and the number of skips from the user, followed by a list of player names terminated by a period. The program constructs a circular linked list of the players, where each node represents a player and the last node links back to the first. It then executes the game by iteratively removing every k-th player until only one player remains. The name of the last remaining player, who is declared the winner, is then printed. The program effectively demonstrates the use of circular linked lists and iterative elimination processes to solve the game.
